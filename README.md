This is a base template for Node.js projects. It includes basic configuration for linting, formatting, and running the project using nodemon. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own `Node.js` projects.

`git clone`

`cd template-node`

`npm i`

## The following scripts are available:

`npm run dev`: Starts the project in development mode using nodemon.

`npm start`: Starts the project in production mode.

`npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for linting errors in your code.

`npm run prettier`: Formats your code using Prettier.

`npm run prepare`: Used by npm to set up Husky.
